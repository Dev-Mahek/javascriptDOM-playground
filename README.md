# âš¡ JavaScript Playground

Over time, it will grow with **snippets, mini-projects, and notes** that reflect my journey as a web developer.

## ðŸš€ Purpose

- Strengthen my core JavaScript knowledge  
- Explore DOM, ES6+, and modern JS concepts  
- Build small interactive projects  
- Document my daily learning progress  

---

## ðŸŒŸ Coming Soon

- `src/` folder with daily practice code  
- `docs/` folder with notes for each concept  
- `demos/` folder with GIFs/screenshots of outputs

Stay tuned â€” this repo will be updated regularly as part of my web development journey!
